Simple misc aux functionality project:
- Logging via spdLog;
- A few simple timing wrapers (based on std::chrono::steady_clock)
- Some system stuff, mainly for windows (dll macros, sleeping, file handling);
- PCG32-based PRNG implementations;
- Precompiled headers;
- Flag field classes;
- A multiple-category counter class;
- Defines of some unit relations and other misc stuff;
